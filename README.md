# Automatic Emesis Detection Pipeline
1. Prepare your own videos
   
    Please place your videos in the 'place_your_video_in_this_folder' folder. You can also change the video path in the detection_pipeline.py script.

2. Emesis detection automatically

    Run detection_pipeline.py script directly by

    ```python detection_pipeline.py```

    And you will get the detected results.

    Before that, you could also change the configs/default.py file to change different model parameters.
